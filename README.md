# Panda3D EGG Syntax VSCode Extension

I personally made this plugin since I was tired of seeing solid-white text when working with Panda3D Egg files.

This is an incomplete plugin, but development for improving this plugin is still planned.

## Features

* Adds Egg file/syntax support into VSCode
* Egg syntax is now colorful!

# Project Timeline
As of this writing, this plugin lacks many crucial features to further integrate EGG workflows with VSCode. That being said, here is a list of features that would be nice for this plugin to eventually have:

* Type hinting for certain egg attributes, such as ``<Scalar> alpha { X }``
* Ability to compile bamfiles inside of vscode
* Other panda3d things.
* Also fix up this readme. Could be written better but I am too busy to do so at the very moment.
